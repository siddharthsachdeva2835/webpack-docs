## Implementation Overview

    * parses a single file and extracts it's dependencies

# what is Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a way of representing the syntax of a programming language as a hierarchical tree-like structure. This structure is used for generating symbol tables for compilers and later code generation. The tree represents all of the constructs in the language and their subsequent rules.
